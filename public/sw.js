// SCOPE:
// the FOLDER where the ServiceWorker is added, defines its scope
// the SCOPE defines the files for which the ServiceWorker is applied
// adding the ServiceWorker to the root-folder ensures, that the ServiceWorker applies to all files

// REGISTER:
// the ServiceWorker needs to be registered in every page of the application, because we don't know
// which page the User is going to visit
// possibilities
// 1) on every html-page
// 2) app.js => if it is registered on every html-page => than we only need to register it once


// IMPLEMENTATION:
